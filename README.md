## Minishell Project

The Minishell project is an implementation of a basic Unix shell in C, created as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum.

### Description

Minishell is a simplified Unix shell, similar to the Bash terminal, developed in the C programming language. This project focuses on understanding and implementing core shell functionalities, such as command execution, built-in commands, environment variables, input/output redirection, and pipes.

### Features

- Command execution: Execute Unix commands and external programs.
- Built-in commands: Support for built-in shell commands like `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `env` vb.
- Input/output redirection: Handle `<` and `>` for input and output redirection.
- Pipes: Implement command pipelines using `|`.
- Environment variables: Manage and manipulate environment variables.
- Error handling: Provide informative error messages for command execution.
